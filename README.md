# PlatformerPygame

hey everyone! 

this is the code i wrote, but i followed a tutorial by russ codes for the platformer game!
i did make a few changes and added things that i felt were necessary, such as an exit button existing at all times!

thank you to russ codes for this amazing pygame projects!
